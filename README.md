# Big data course 2019

Authors: Marc, Loic, Liubov, Anirudh, Felix

Big data course which we are making at CRI cri-paris.org for Fall 2019.

# Course description on network theory
This course will provide an introduction to the field of big data, with a focus on network data and data for mental health. Topics will cover data project management, infrastructure of big data, data analysis and visualisation, and mental health data. The course will be divided into a big data and a network data parts.


Why focus on network data? Over the past century, network studies have had significant impact in disciplines as varied as mathematics, sociology, physics, biology, computer science or quantitative geography, giving birth to Network Science as a field of itself. With the recent rise of social networks in the last decade, their use has now become widespread in the digital world. Here we will provide an introduction to the field of Network Science,  from the theoretical foundations (generating, analysing, perturbing networks) to the practical hands-on part (analysis and visualisation of a real-world networks). 

# Network topics will cover
a. How to construct networks from real data?
b. How to analyze networks? (centrality measures, community detection, statistical analyses etc.)
c. How to visualise networks? 
d. Dynamics and spreading phenomena on networks (epidemics / information spreading, diffusion)
e. How do networks wirings change in time? (network robustness, temporal networks)
f. How to represent more complex network data? Multilayer, multiplex networks.

Students will select, analyse and present a network of their choice as part of a personal project for the course. They will also choose an advanced topic in network science & big data for which they will make a presentation in a reverse classroom setting. They will in particular contribute to a wikipedia page about that topic.
